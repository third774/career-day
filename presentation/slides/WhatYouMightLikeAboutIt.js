        Aiden Horwitz, a 13-year-old student at Austin Jewish Academy, created{" "}
        <Link href="https://DogDoOrDogDont.org">DogDoOrDogDont.org</Link>, a
        website that tells users which shelter dogs at Austin Pets Alive might
        be right for them. Prospective pet owners can fill out a survey about
        their lives -- the size of their home, the amount of barking they can
        tolerate, how long a future pooch might be home alone each day and more
        -- and receive a score. That score matches the user to a category of dog
        that might be right for them. Horwtizâ€™s website links to dogs available
        for adoption from Austin Pets Alive under each category.

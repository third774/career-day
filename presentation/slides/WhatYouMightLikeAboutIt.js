          Sarah Drasner is an expert in my field and specializes in something
          called vector graphics. Here is an animated Wall-E graphic she made
          that responds to mouse movements.

            <Link href="https://DogDoOrDogDont.org">DogDoOrDogDont.org</Link>, a
            website that tells users which shelter dogs at Austin Pets Alive
            might be right for them. Prospective pet owners can fill out a
            survey about their lives -- the size of their home, the amount of
            barking they can tolerate, how long a future pooch might be home
            alone each day and more -- and receive a score. That score matches
            the user to a category of dog that might be right for them.
            Horwtizâ€™s website links to dogs available for adoption from Austin
            Pets Alive under each category."

          A 13 year old kid named Aiden Horwitz here in Austin built something I
          think is pretty awesome - a website to help dogs who are up for
          adoption find good homes. Users fill out a survey answer questions
          about their lives, and are matched with dogs based on the answers.
